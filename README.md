# what-do-I-do-here-
What is thiz? I don't get how this works send help!
Do I just start writing code here? What do I do? I know I am to blame for not exploring this earlier. I still live with my parents and they turn the wifi off at night and I always remember to open GitHub at night so I'm usually stressin' when I'm here. I will explore GitHub tomorrow morning. For now, I'll leave this. (5.22.25)
Update I did not open github earlier and not it's 11:46pm and the wifi is about to be cut off. (5.23.25)

I forgot to open github yesterday lol, at this point I'm just going to make this a daily journal from now on. I just want to fill those tiny boxes green tbh. (5.25.25)
I'm goona try to make this fast 'cause it's currently 11:55pm. I stopped the html course on freecodecamp (for now). I tried the SQL island game last night and then this afternoon at 2pm I finished the game and got a certificate. I then started the relations database course on freecodecamp and so far I've finished 2 lessons from it. I'm now sure that I really would focus on being a data analyst/scientist or anything that has to do with data and pays well as a job. That's all bye (5.26.25 11:59pm)
