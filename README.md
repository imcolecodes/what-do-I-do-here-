# what-do-I-do-here-
What is thiz? I don't get how this works send help!
Do I just start writing code here? What do I do? I know I am to blame for not exploring this earlier. I still live with my parents and they turn the wifi off at night and I always remember to open GitHub at night so I'm usually stressin' when I'm here. I will explore GitHub tomorrow morning. For now, I'll leave this. (5.22.25)

Update I did not open github earlier and not it's 11:46pm and the wifi is about to be cut off. (5.23.25)

I forgot to open github yesterday lol, at this point I'm just going to make this a daily journal from now on. I just want to fill those tiny boxes green tbh. (5.25.25)

I'm goona try to make this fast 'cause it's currently 11:55pm. I stopped the html course on freecodecamp (for now). I tried the SQL island game last night and then this afternoon at 2pm I finished the game and got a certificate. I then started the relations database course on freecodecamp and so far I've finished 2 lessons from it. I'm now sure that I really would focus on being a data analyst/scientist or anything that has to do with data and pays well as a job. That's all bye (5.26.25 11:59pm)

Yesterday I finished two lessons from the relations database course on freecodecamp, then I went to sleep. This morning I tried the third lesson without reading the description. I did not know it was a project type, I was lost cuz I kinda forgot the lesson I did the night before lol. I then gave up and closed the tab. Unlucky me I did not save what I already accomplished, I overlooked the instructions on top and only noticed it when I tried to open it again hoping to continue my work. That was in the morning, after that I just lazed around scrolling through my phone and stuff. I also did some research about an hour ago about the actuarial exams. That's it for today. I'll try to finish that 3rd lesson in freecodecamp tomorrow. Oh another thing, I just found out I got waitlisted at one of my backup colleges. (5.27.25  11:23pm)

I just finished one of the projects needed to get a certificate in relational database (I just realized it wasn't relations lol) in freecodecamp. It was making a celestial bodies database, I gave up on it yesterday but lukily I coninued it today and now I'm done. I was confused on how to submit the link needed though. Lucky me, there was a some kind of forum and there was a detailed instruction on how to make a repository on github and get the link and send it, I am now done with it and will continue tomorrow. I also kinda learned a bit about github but I think I'll still use this as somewhat of a journal LOL. That's all for today. (5.28.25 11:07pm)

I just started the 4th lesson in relational database and I still haven't finished it lol. I just decided to write here first before trying to cram that freecodecamp lesson before this day ends. (5.29.25 10:05pm)

I finally finished the lesson I started yesterday in freecodecamp. It was a five project lesson and where I make four different type of projects and then compiled them all in the fifth one. After finishing that, I then started the next lesson which was similar to the 2nd lesson and the 1st project I made. It was related to databases and such and I just finished it a few minutes ago, I am now thinking of starting the next one because as it turns out it was a 2 part lesson. I just decided to update this first because the wifi might be turned off a few moments later. (5.30.25 10:22pm)

I just finished the part 2 lesson from last night and I am now doing the project (5.31.25 9:18pm)

nothing (6.1.25) 

Just to give more context about yesterday, I did not do much lol and I was running out of time to write yesterday because the wifi was about to be turned off. I did finish most of the project I was working on, I only needed to do the querying.sh file and I was done. Unfortunately, I took a break and the next thing I know is I'm watching a series and I just finished the series around 5pm today (I started the series yesterday morning and I finshed it at 5pm today). After that I fortunately had the motivation to continue the project which I HAVE FINALLY FINISHED! I also looked back in my entries here and realized it's been a week since I started this relational database course and I've done more that the HTML course I've started years ago. It made me realize that maybe data analytics is really for me. I do hope to turn into a data scientist or data engineer once I've mastered data analytics. I will finish this course within this week and then I'll start another data related course. (6.2.25 10:21pm)

I almost forgot to update here today. I just discovered this morning that I used up my free credits in gitpod and my next free credits would be after june 26. After that I kinda lost motivation so I did nothing today. (6.3.25 10:53pm)
