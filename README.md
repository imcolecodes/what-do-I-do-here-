# what-do-I-do-here-
What is thiz? I don't get how this works send help!
Do I just start writing code here? What do I do? I know I am to blame for not exploring this earlier. I still live with my parents and they turn the wifi off at night and I always remember to open GitHub at night so I'm usually stressin' when I'm here. I will explore GitHub tomorrow morning. For now, I'll leave this. (5.22.25)

Update I did not open github earlier and not it's 11:46pm and the wifi is about to be cut off. (5.23.25)

I forgot to open github yesterday lol, at this point I'm just going to make this a daily journal from now on. I just want to fill those tiny boxes green tbh. (5.25.25)

I'm goona try to make this fast 'cause it's currently 11:55pm. I stopped the html course on freecodecamp (for now). I tried the SQL island game last night and then this afternoon at 2pm I finished the game and got a certificate. I then started the relations database course on freecodecamp and so far I've finished 2 lessons from it. I'm now sure that I really would focus on being a data analyst/scientist or anything that has to do with data and pays well as a job. That's all bye (5.26.25 11:59pm)

Yesterday I finished two lessons from the relations database course on freecodecamp, then I went to sleep. This morning I tried the third lesson without reading the description. I did not know it was a project type, I was lost cuz I kinda forgot the lesson I did the night before lol. I then gave up and closed the tab. Unlucky me I did not save what I already accomplished, I overlooked the instructions on top and only noticed it when I tried to open it again hoping to continue my work. That was in the morning, after that I just lazed around scrolling through my phone and stuff. I also did some research about an hour ago about the actuarial exams. That's it for today. I'll try to finish that 3rd lesson in freecodecamp tomorrow. Oh another thing, I just found out I got waitlisted at one of my backup colleges. (5.27.25  11:23pm)

I just finished one of the projects needed to get a certificate in relational database (I just realized it wasn't relations lol) in freecodecamp. It was making a celestial bodies database, I gave up on it yesterday but lukily I coninued it today and now I'm done. I was confused on how to submit the link needed though. Lucky me, there was a some kind of forum and there was a detailed instruction on how to make a repository on github and get the link and send it, I am now done with it and will continue tomorrow. I also kinda learned a bit about github but I think I'll still use this as somewhat of a journal LOL. That's all for today. (5.28.25 11:07pm)

I just started the 4th lesson in relational database and I still haven't finished it lol. I just decided to write here first before trying to cram that freecodecamp lesson before this day ends. (5.29.25 10:05pm)

I finally finished the lesson I started yesterday in freecodecamp. It was a five project lesson and where I make four different type of projects and then compiled them all in the fifth one. After finishing that, I then started the next lesson which was similar to the 2nd lesson and the 1st project I made. It was related to databases and such and I just finished it a few minutes ago, I am now thinking of starting the next one because as it turns out it was a 2 part lesson. I just decided to update this first because the wifi might be turned off a few moments later. (5.30.25 10:22pm)

I just finished the part 2 lesson from last night and I am now doing the project (5.31.25 9:18pm)

nothing (6.1.25) 

Just to give more context about yesterday, I did not do much lol and I was running out of time to write yesterday because the wifi was about to be turned off. I did finish most of the project I was working on, I only needed to do the querying.sh file and I was done. Unfortunately, I took a break and the next thing I know is I'm watching a series and I just finished the series around 5pm today (I started the series yesterday morning and I finshed it at 5pm today). After that I fortunately had the motivation to continue the project which I HAVE FINALLY FINISHED! I also looked back in my entries here and realized it's been a week since I started this relational database course and I've done more that the HTML course I've started years ago. It made me realize that maybe data analytics is really for me. I do hope to turn into a data scientist or data engineer once I've mastered data analytics. I will finish this course within this week and then I'll start another data related course. (6.2.25 10:21pm)

I almost forgot to update here today. I just discovered this morning that I used up my free credits in gitpod and my next free credits would be after june 26. After that I kinda lost motivation so I did nothing today. (6.3.25 10:53pm)

Again, I did not accomplish anything today. I did check out the other courses offered in freecodecamp then went back to scrolling in tiktok and I just started watching 'One Day' a few minutes ago lol. (6.4.25 10:24pm)

I finally started the data visualization course on fCC a few minutes ago and so far I've finished 2 lessons. My goal right now is to finish this course before June 26 because by then I would have credits in gitpod to finish the relational database course. (6.5.25 9:06pm)

Another unproductive day. (6.6.25 10:03)

Guess what? Another unproductive day for me! But hey, it's a weekend so I'm giving  myself a break, I'll get back on monday. (6.7.25 9:08pm)

Well another unproductive day but I just finished 2 lessons in the data visualization course on fCC. (6.8.25 9:12pm)

So I was still unproductive today, but I am cramming stuff right now in freecodecamp. I was initially continuing the data visualization course but I gave up because even after looking at the hint and coppying it, my code still does not pass. Before I could completely lose my mind I dropped that and went to the responsive web design course. I kind of understand html more because I did try (and almost finished) the html lesson in the certified full stack dev program in fCC which I dropped back then to try relational database. But the course I'm doing right now (the responsive web dev) integrated html and css so this might take me awhile. (6.9.25 9:18pm)

So yesterday I said I encountered a problem in the data visualization course on fCC, before totally giving up I first posted my problem in their forum. I came back today and saw that my post has an answer and I finally knew what was wrong with my code. Very grateful to that person who helped me. I am now back on track. Also I just tried coding this evening 'cause I went out today then lazed around for a few hours after returning home. (6.10.25 9:18pm)

Nothing. (6.11.25 10:45pm)

Nothing. again. But I am currently trying to finish some lessons in data visualization in fCC right now (6. 12. 25 9:21pm)

I did a bit of data visualization. (6.13.25 9:57pm)

Honestly? I did nothing today, well I did cram some data visualization lessons, and I mean 1 or 2 lessons lol. (6.14.25 9:37pm)

Guess what? nothing again. (6.15.25 9:10pm)

I did do some lessons in data visualization yesterday, maybe one or two. Today, FINALLY, I finished one course in data visualization. I guess that's a win for today. (6.16.25 8:55pm)

And again, I did nothing today. (6.17.25 8:50pm)

Nothing. (6.18.25 10:10pm)

I think I was productive today. I did try to continue the next lesson in data visualization but I did not find it interesting so I started something else. I started the legacy javascript algorithims and data structures certification program and so far I'm learning basic javascript. I am enjoying it as of the moment. I also decided to try the basic SQL certification in HackerRank and I passed. I thing that's a good day today. (6.19.25 9:25pm)

I earned my first badge in HackerRank today! (6.20.25 9:55pm)

Nooothinggg. (6.21.25 9:29pm)

[TO FURTHER ELABORATE ABOUT YESTERDAY, After writing my entry last night I then went on to try the intermediate SQL certification on HackerRank. I failed, I ran out of time trying to figure out how to solve the second question that involved three tables. Now I know to always prepare first before taking a certification test.] Now for what I did today, I found two websites that offer SQL lessons. One was free, it was SQLBolt and I am now at lesson five, but it does not offer a certificate. The other one also offers free lessons, it's Codecademy, but you do need to pay to get a certificate. (6.22.25 10:00pm)

I finished one lesson on SQLBolt. That was it. (6.23.25 7:49pm)
