# what-do-I-do-here-
What is thiz? I don't get how this works send help!
Do I just start writing code here? What do I do? I know I am to blame for not exploring this earlier. I still live with my parents and they turn the wifi off at night and I always remember to open GitHub at night so I'm usually stressin' when I'm here. I will explore GitHub tomorrow morning. For now, I'll leave this.
Update I did not open github earlier and not it's 11:46pm and the wifi is about to be cut off.
